## Bylaws of the International Consortium for (the study of) Freezing of Gait (ICFOG).

### ARTICLE I: NAME

This organization shall be known as the International Consortium for Freezing of Gait (ICFOG). It represents a consortium of scientific and clinical investigators from international institutions who are committed to cooperative planning, implementation, analysis, and reporting of research about Freezing of Gait (FOG).

### ARTICLE II: OBJECTIVES

The overarching objective of the organization is to understand the neurologic origin of FOG and to use this information to develop interventions to prevent FOG or to treat FOG once it appears.

1. To create a research collaborative consortium that will develop research proposals; develop and validate outcome measures; perform research projects including clinical trials and set up a data sharing platform.
2. To advance knowledge about the cause, pathogenesis, clinical impact, treatment, and prevention of FOG in Parkinson’s disease and related disorders.
3. To bring together researchers from a range of countries and from various scientific and clinical disciplines working in the field of FOG for international meetings.
4. To inform clinicians, researchers, and the general public of the results and implications of current research in this area.

### ARTICLE III: ORGANIZATION

ICFOG, founded in 2023, is organized as an independent, nonprofit organization of scientific and clinical investigators who conduct research at the institutions with which they are affiliated. The views of the ICFOG do not necessarily represent the views of the institutions with which the investigators are affiliated or those of any individual ICFOG member.

### ARTICLE IV: MEMBERSHIP

Voting Members will include all Active Members. An active membership is maintained by members who have been active by attending a ICFOG meeting within the past four years, and /or participating in any ongoing ICFOG project, and/or are active members of any ICFOG committees, and/or becoming active ICFOG members within the past four years. Each voting member will have one vote. Votes are not transferable to other persons and cannot be cast as a proxy in instances when the presence of the voting member is required. Only active members may hold office. Any member may resign at any time by giving written notice to the Secretary/Treasurer.

Affiliated members may include any person with interests consistent with the stated goals of the ICFOG. This may include, but is not limited to, former active members who volunteered to withdraw from active membership but remain involved, representatives from industry, Foundations, and patient advocacy groups. Affiliated members have no voting rights.

Approval of a new member’s application to become a member will take place at every Executive Committee meeting. New members can be self-nominated or nominated by an active ICFOG member.

The credentials of the applicant will be reviewed by the Executive Committee, or a subcommittee appointed by the Chair (i.e., Membership Committee). There are no definitive criteria for new membership, however, it is expected that members have already meaningfully contributed to the field of FOG research. The executive committee will vote on approval. A majority of the received votes is necessary to approve the proposed member. A vote is only valid if 2/3 of current members of the Executive Committee cast a ballot. A negative vote will require a statement of reason to be submitted explaining the negative vote.

### ARTICLE XI: ICFOG STUDIES

Any active or affiliated member of the ICFOG may submit an application to the Executive Committee for authorization of a ICFOG multicenter study by submitting a sufficiently detailed summary or outline of the proposed protocol and source of funding. In its decision as to whether to authorize a study, the Executive Committee shall comment on the aims, objectives, scientific and clinical adequacy of the protocol, qualifications, and capabilities of the investigators, mechanism for funding, and sponsorship for the proposed trial.

For each authorized study, a Principal Investigator (PI) and Co-Principal Investigator (Co-PI) will be submitting members of the proposal. The PI and Co-PI, who may or may not be members of the Executive Committee, should represent different institutions. The PI, if not a member of the Executive Committee, shall become an ex officio member of the Executive Committee.

The PI and Co-PI for each authorized ICFOG trial shall appoint a steering committee consisting of four investigators who preferably are not directly involved in the evaluation of subjects for that trial and are not participating as investigators in competing, commercially sponsored trials. All members of the steering committee, including the chief biostatistician, must be approved by the Executive Committee. Every effort should be made by the Chair, Executive Committee, PI, Co-PI and the steering committee to solicit participation from a wide selection of ICFOG sites.

All research will be conducted according to the Declaration of Helsinki and according to Good Clinical Practice Guidelines. All research will receive human studies approval and participants will be required to sign an Informed Consent Form as approved by a human studies committee.

The PI and Co-PI will formulate the protocol and the steering committee will review and approve. The PI and Co-PI along with the steering committee will oversee the implementation, supervising the analysis and reporting of the study. The PI will also be responsible for securing adequate sponsorship and support. Funding for the study will be directed primarily through an account at the affiliated institution of the PI, under the rules and regulations of that institution and of the sponsor. The PI, through his or her institution, will be responsible for sub-contractual arrangements with the participating investigators and their institutions. The Co-PI will assist the PI in carrying out these responsibilities and assume the responsibilities of the PI in the event that the PI is absent or incapacitated.

Each PI, Co-PI and steering committee will be responsible for the selection of site investigators for that study. Participating site investigators for the study will be selected from the current ICFOG listing of voting and affiliated members and of other qualified investigators who request participation.

Each steering committee will also be responsible for removing from active study participation any steering committee member, investigator, or coordinator, who does not fulfill his/her obligations to the study or who does not maintain the standards of the ICFOG with respect to confidentiality, conflict-of-interest, disclosure or publications policies.

### ARTICLE XII: ICFOG PUBLICATION POLICIES

Authorship and acknowledgements of various types of articles should be formulated according to the
following guidelines:

1. All articles utilizing data on patients recruited as part of a study must acknowledge support from the study sponsor(s), unless advised by the sponsor that an acknowledgment is not necessary.
2. The PI and Co-PI will have discretion on authorship of peer-reviewed articles on the major objectives and general demographic descriptions of the study populations. General guidelines include having either the ICFOG with membership listed in a footnote, or the members of the ICFOG in the following order: the primary author, ICFOG investigators in order of the number of their patients enrolled in the study, ICFOG site coordinators in order of their investigators, ICFOG members without responsibility for subjects, and the Principal Investigator and Co-Principal Investigator if not the primary authors, unless otherwise agreed on by the authors.

2. ICFOG members directly involved with a ICFOG affiliated study sponsored by an “involved company” agree not to serve as paid consultants to an “involved company” in relation to the study drug during the period of an active clinical study (this does not include open-label extensions to studies). Scientific consultation to the “involved company” on issues not related to an ongoing clinical study by the ICFOG is permitted. Such consulting services must be disclosed to the Executive Committee on an annual basis.
3. Certain activities with “involved companies” are not considered to be a conflict-of-interest. These activities include: (a) serving as an educator, e.g., giving a lecture or speaking in a panel discussion at a forum sponsored by an “involved company”; (b) participating in research activities unrelated to the study drug or product, and supported by the “involved company”. Honoraria for speaking in an educational program may be kept by the ICFOG member.
4. These CONFLICT-OF-INTEREST GUIDELINES will apply from the time of recruitment of subjects into a study until one-month following public disclosure of the results of the study or one month after the study has been completed. This will be binding for all members including those who might leave the study, for any reason, prior to its completion.
5. Members of the ICFOG should insist on full and meaningful disclosure of financial support for educational events in which they are invited to participate. Members of the ICFOG should fully disclose their research support, consultation fees, honoraria, and any significant financial interest with manufacturers(s) of commercial products related to the topic of their presentation for education events in which they participate.
6. An ICFOG member may be paid as a consultant to develop a research protocol that will be sponsored by a company so long as the study has not yet begun and there are no other conflicts-of-interest as noted above.
