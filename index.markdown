The International Consortium for Freezing of Gait (ICFOG) is an international academic society aimed at improving our understanding of FOG as it appears in Parkinson's disease (PD) and other movement disorders. ICFOG was initially proposed at the Jerusalem Conference on Freezing of Gait in Jerusalem, Israel, March 2023. Initial by-laws and inaugural leadership were established in early 2024. This site provides more information about ICFOG, including the first annual meeting - ICFOG2025 - in Atlanta, Georgia, June 3-6, 2025.
