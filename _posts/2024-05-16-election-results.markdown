Dear ICFOG Members:

We are delighted to report the results of our recent (first) election, as laid out below:

**Chair:** Simon Lewis  
**Vice-Chair:** Alice Nieuwboer  
**Secretary/Treasurer:** Stewart Factor  
**At-Large Members (8 year term):** Kaylena Ehgoetz-Martens & J. Lucas McKay  
**At-Large Members (4 year term):** Jeffrey Hausdorff & Monika PÃ¶tter-Nerger  

The committee will now establish and convene a number of working groups. We will be approaching you, the members of the ICFOG, for your participation. It is a very exciting time for our field, and we hope that, with our planned meeting in Atlanta June 3-6, 2025 (SAVE THE DATE), we will have a fabulous springboard that will foster our community.

Best wishes,  
Stewart, Alice, and Simon
