The International Consortium for Freezing of Gait (ICFOG) is an international academic and clinical professional organization that aims to advance the scientific understanding and clinical treatment of Freezing of Gait (FOG), a gait disorder that is common in Parkinson's disease and other conditions.

ICFOG was initially proposed at the Jerusalem Conference on Freezing of Gait in Jerusalem, Israel, March 2023.
Initial by-laws and inaugural leadership were established in early 2024.
